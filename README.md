## Numpy Introduction and Performance Comparison

This notebook demonstrates:

- **How to use `numpy` for array operations.**
- **A comparison of performance between native Python lists and `numpy` arrays.**

---

## Contents

- **Importing libraries:** Initializes `numpy` and `time`.
- **Zipping two lists:** Shows how `zip` can be used to combine two lists into pairs.
- **Performance comparison:** Measures and prints the execution time for adding two large lists and two large `numpy` arrays.
- **Conclusion:** Highlights that `numpy` performs faster than native Python lists for large array operations.

---

## Requirements

- **Python 3.x**
- **Numpy**

```bash
pip install numpy
```

---

## How to use

1. **Open this notebook in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.**
2. **Step through the cells and execute them in order.**
3. The output will show:
   - The result of zipping two small lists.
   - The time taken to add large native Python lists.
   - The time taken to add large `numpy` arrays.

## Summary

This notebook illustrates:
✅ The ease of performing vectorized operations with `numpy`.
✅ The performance benefits of `numpy` over pure Python for large datasets.
